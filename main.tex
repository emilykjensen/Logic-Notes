\section{Purpose}
Since joining a new research group last semester I've been thrust back into the world of formal logic and reasoning. My mental muscles using precise definitions and proofs from college are a bit weak! The document will serve as a central location to re-acquaint myself with these topics and become more comfortable with the world of modal logic. My goal is to provide basic definitions, intuitive explanations (when possible) and practical tips for writing about logic using \LaTeX. These notes are intended just for me, but I'd be happy if they helped someone else as well.
